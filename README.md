D & D character creator:
Summary:
•	The project is supposed to be a java program that helps the user create a character in the popular board game Dungeons and Dragons. 
•	The character so far consists of three attributes: name, race, and charClass.
•	Each scene is its own class.
To do:
•	The program still needs an array or a list
•	Each member must work on one class
•	Each race, and class, can each be refined for better selection than text entry
•	The programs scenes do not close when the next loads, this leads to unnecessary hardware strain.
